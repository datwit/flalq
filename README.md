# My First Project: Flask-SQLAlchemy project with MySQL example database
## Danay Meneses Abad


I have started to dabble in Python programming. I still have a lot to learn but I am going with great wishes. I study at home with the remote guidance of an "experienced" teacher. So this insurance project will not be a standard like that of a great developer.

However, here is my best effort every day, consulting countless web sites and reading a variety of documents, to get the best out of all that suits the idea of each project.

In this one in particular, since it is the first and I have been testing many things at the same time, for which the "environment" has several packages that are not necessary.

My laptop resources:
* HP EliteBook
* W7 Professional SP1 a 64 bits
* Intel Core i5
* 8 GB RAM
